Enterprise software marks a special high-grade class of software that makes
careful use of relevant software architecture design principles to build
particularly customizable and extensible solutions to real problems. This
project is an example of how the popular FizzBuzz game might be built were it
subject to the high quality standards of enterprise software.

## This is special edition of FizzBuzz, rebranded as abcdef, made for [corporate order from Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-elegant-piece-of-code-you-can-write-in-your-favorite-programming-language-that-prints-the-numbers-from-100-to-200). It has been open-sourced to give it more hype.


For numbers 100 through 200,

* if the number is divisible by 3 print abc;
* if the number is divisible by 5 print def;
* if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (15) print abcdef;
* else, print the number.
